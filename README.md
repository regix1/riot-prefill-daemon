Riot Games prefill daemon for [LANCache](https://lancache.net/) — a companion to
[**LANCache Manager**](https://github.com/regix1/lancache-manager), which
coordinates the prefill providers.

It downloads Riot Games content (League of Legends and Valorant) through your
lancache *before* you install, so the real install — and every other machine on
your LAN — pulls from the cache at full LAN speed instead of the internet.
Nothing is written to disk: bytes stream through the cache and are discarded.

## Why use it

- **Cache warm before you install** — pre-download titles overnight, install instantly later.
- **LAN speed for every machine after the first** — the second install of the same version is served from cache.
- **No disk writes, no free space needed** — bytes stream through and are discarded, sparing your SSD.
- **No login, anonymous** — Riot's content is public, so there is nothing to sign in to.
- **Headless daemon** — driven by LANCache Manager or any socket client.

## Quick start

**Recommended — run it through [LANCache Manager](https://github.com/regix1/lancache-manager).**
LANCache Manager installs, configures, and drives this daemon alongside the other
prefill providers, so you never touch the socket protocol by hand. This is the
supported path for almost everyone.

**Standalone (.NET 8 SDK)** — build and run from source:

```bash
dotnet build RiotPrefill/RiotPrefill.csproj -c Release
dotnet run  --project RiotPrefill/RiotPrefill.csproj -c Release
```

No login required — content is public, so you can prefill straight away.

> A prebuilt container image is published at `ghcr.io/regix1/riot-prefill-daemon`
> for advanced/manual setups. It is a socket-driven daemon (volumes `/commands`,
> `/responses`, `/app/Config`, `/app/.cache`), so see
> [LANCache Manager](https://github.com/regix1/lancache-manager) and the repo docs
> for the full container configuration rather than running it ad hoc.

## How it works

1. **No login needed** — Riot's content is publicly fetchable; there is nothing to authenticate.
2. **Select titles** — choose from League of Legends and Valorant.
3. **Resolve** — release metadata, manifests, and CDN URLs are looked up from Riot's content system.
4. **Prefill** — each title's content is fetched through the lancache and discarded, warming the cache.

## Requirements

- A running [LANCache](https://lancache.net/) with the **`riot`** cache-domain
  group enabled (from [uklans/cache-domains](https://github.com/uklans/cache-domains)).
- No account needed — content is public.
- Docker, or the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) to build from source.
